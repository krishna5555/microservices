## Overview
![Architecture](https://github.com/krishna5555/microservices/blob/main/movie-catalog/architecture.png)
- Movie catalog is a service that lists the movie, description and user rating.
- This application is designed using Microservices architecture.
- There are four Spring Boot application projects in the entire architecture each acting as a microservice.
- Movie Catalog Service is the client here.
- Movie Info Service and Ratings Data Service provide service to the client(Movie Catalog Service)
- Eureka Discovery Server takes care of forwarding the request and response.
- The client and services are registered to the Eureka Discovery Server. This can be viewed on the Spring Eureka Dashboard as shown below.

- Once all the services are registered, the clients can send request and receive response.
- In this case, the Movie Catalog Service requests for movie and ratings info from the other two services.
- The Movie Catalog Service first looks up for the services registered in Eureka Discovery Server. It firsts sends a request to Movie Info Service to get movie details and then sends a request to Ratings Service to get user ratings of the movie.
